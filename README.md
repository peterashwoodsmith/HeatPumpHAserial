This is a Zigbee end point controller for a Mitsubishi Heat Pump via its CT105 serial port.
For full details on code/hardware see the HeatPumpHAserial.ino code.

Also included are a trivial little box and lid that conveniently fit the hardware on the side
of the heat pump that you can 3d print or of course any plastic box of suitable dimensions would work.

See the comments in the HeatPumpHAserial.ino for full details.
